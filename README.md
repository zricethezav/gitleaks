Gitleaks is a SAST tool for detecting hardcoded secrets like passwords, api keys, and tokens in git repos. Gitleaks is an **easy-to-use, all-in-one solution** for finding secrets, past or present, in your code.

### Features:
- Scan for [commited](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks#Scanning) secrets
- Scan for [unstaged](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks#scan-unstaged-changes) secrets to shift security left
- Scan [directories and files](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks#scan-local-directory)
- Run [Gitleaks Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/gitleaks) in your CI/CD pipeline
- [Custom rules](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks#configuration) via toml configuration
- Increased performance using [go-git](https://github.com/go-git/go-git)
- json, sarif, and csv reporting
- Private repo scans using key or password based authentication


### Installation
Gitleaks can be installed using Homebrew, Docker, or Go. Gitleaks is also available in binary form for many popular platforms and OS types on the [releases page](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks/releases). In addition, Gitleaks can be implemented as a pre-commit hook directly in your repo.

##### MacOS

### [Scanning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUzpRL8mKCk)

#### Basic repo-url scan:
This scans the entire history of tests/secrets and logs leaks as they are encountered `-v`/`--verbose` being set.
```bash
gitleaks --repo-url=https://github.com/my-insecure/repo -v
```


#### Basic repo-url scan output to a report:
If you want the report in sarif or csv you can set the `-f/--format` option
```bash
gitleaks --repo-url=https://github.com/my-insecure/repo -v --report=my-report.json
```

#### Scan specific commit:
```bash
gitleaks --repo-url=https://github.com/my-insecure/repo --commit=commit-sha -v
```

#### Scan local repo:
```bash
gitleaks --path=path/to/local/repo -v
```

#### Scan repos contained in a parent directory:
If you have `repo1`, `repo2`, `repo3` all under `path/to/local`, gitleaks will discover and scan those repos.
```bash
gitleaks --path=path/to/local/ -v
```

#### Scan local directory:
If you want to scan the current contents of a repo, ignoring git alltogether. You can use the `--no-git` option to do this.
```bash
gitleaks --path=path/to/local/repo -v --no-git
```

#### Scan a file:
Or if you want to scan a single file using gitleaks rules. You can do this by specifying the file in `--path` and including the `--no-git` option.
```bash
gitleaks --path=path/to/local/repo/main.go -v --no-git
```

#### Scan unstaged changes:
If you have unstaged changes are are currently at the root of the repo, you can run `gitleaks` with no `--path` or `--repo-url` specified which will run a scan on your uncommitted changes. Or if you want to specify a 
path, you can run:
```bash
gitleaks --path=path/to/local/repo -v --unstaged
```


### Configuration
Provide your own gitleaks configurations with `--config-path` or `--repo-config-path`. `--config-path` loads a local gitleaks configuration whereas `--repo-config-path` will load a configuration present just in the repo you want to scan. For example, `gitleaks --repo-config-path=".github/gitleaks.config"`.
The default configuration Gitleaks uses is located [here](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks/blob/master/config/default.go). More configuration examples can be seen [here](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks/tree/master/examples). Configuration files will contain a few different toml tables. Further explanation is provided below.

### Rules summary

The rules are written in [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) as defined in [TomlLoader struct](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks/blob/master/config/config.go#L57-L87), and can be summarized as:

```


[[rules]]
  description = "a string describing one of many rule in this config"
  regex = '''one-go-style-regex-for-this-rule''' 
  file = '''a-file-name-regex'''
  path = '''a-file-path-regex'''
  tags = ["tag","another tag"]
  [[rules.entropies]] # note these are strings, not floats
    Min = "3.5"
    Max = "4.5"
    Group = "1"
  [rules.allowlist]
    description = "a string"
    files = ['''one-file-name-regex''']
    commits = [ "commit-A", "commit-B"]
    paths = ['''one-file-path-regex''']
    regexes = ['''one-regex-within-the-already-matched-regex''']

[allowlist]
  description = "a description string for a global allowlist config"
  commits = [ "commit-A", "commit-B"]
  files = [ '''file-regex-a''', '''file-regex-b''']
  paths = [ '''path-regex-a''', '''path-regex-b''']
  repos = [ '''repo-regex-a''', '''repo-regex-b''']
  regexes = ['''one-regex-within-the-already-matched-regex''']
```

Regular expressions are _NOT_ the full Perl set, so there are no look-aheads or look-behinds.


### Examples
#### Example 1
The first and most commonly edited array of tables is `[[rules]]`. This is where you can define your own custom rules for Gitleaks to use while scanning repos. Example keys/values within the `[[rules]]` table:
```
[[rules]]
  description = "generic secret regex"
  regex = '''secret(.{0,20})([0-9a-zA-Z-._{}$\/\+=]{20,120})'''
  tags = ["secret", "example"]
```
#### Example 2
We can also **combine** regular expressions AND entropy:
```
[[rules]]
  description = "entropy and regex example"
  regex = '''secret(.{0,20})['|"]([0-9a-zA-Z-._{}$\/\+=]{20,120})['|"]'''
  [[rules.Entropies]]
	Min = "4.5"
        Max = "4.7"
```
Translating this rule to English, this rule states: "if we encounter a line of code that matches *regex* AND the line falls within the bounds of a [Shannon entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)) of 4.5 to 4.7, then the line must be a leak"

#### Example 3
Let's compare two lines of code: 
```
aws_secret='ABCDEF+c2L7yXeGvUyrPgYsDnWRRC1AYEXAMPLE'
```
and 
```
aws_secret=os.getenv('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')

```
The first line of code is an example of a hardcoded secret being assigned to the variable `aws_secret`. The second line of code is an example of a secret being assigned via env variables to `aws_secret`. Both would be caught by the rule defined in *example 2* but only the first line is actually a leak. Let's define a new rule that will capture only the first line of code. We can do this by combining regular expression **groups** and entropy.
```
[[rules]]
  description = "entropy and regex example"
  regex = '''secret(.{0,20})['|"]([0-9a-zA-Z-._{}$\/\+=]{20,120})['|"]'''
  [[rules.Entropies]]
	Min = "4.5"
        Max = "4.7"
        Group = "2"
```
Notice how we added `Group = "2"` to this rule. We can translate this rule to English: "if we encounter a line of code that matches regex AND the entropy of the *second regex group* falls within the bounds of a [Shannon entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)) of 4.5 to 4.7, then the line must be a leak"

### Example 4: Using allowlist regex

The proper Perl regex for AWS secret keys is
`(?<![A-Za-z0-9\\+])[A-Za-z0-9\\+=]{40}(?![A-Za-z0-9\\+=])`
but the Go library doesn't do lookahead/lookbehind, so
we'll look for 40 base64 characters, then allowlist
if they're embedded in a string of 41 base64 characters, that is, 
without any delimiters. This will make a false negative for, say:
```
    foo=+awsSecretAccessKeyisBase64=40characters
```
So you can use the following to effectively create the proper Perl regex:
```
[[rules]]
	description = "AWS secret key regardless of labeling"
	regex = '''.?[A-Za-z0-9\\+=]{40}.?'''
	[rules.allowlist]
                description = "41 base64 characters is not an AWS secret key"
		regexes = ['''[A-Za-z0-9\\+=]{41}''']
		
```



### Exit Codes
You can always set the exit code when leaves are encountered with the `--leaks-exit-code` flag. Default exit codes below:
```
0 - no leaks present
1 - leaks or error encountered
```
